### Locator

It is a Play 2 Scala app.

It can get your location name based on your location coordinates(latitude and longitude) or IP address.

Inside you can find

* Async calls to Google, Bing or MaxMing GeoIP2 database.
* An AngularJS enabled frontend, using Webjars for dependency management.

Enjoy life and Locator, too.
